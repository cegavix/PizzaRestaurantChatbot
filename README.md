# Natural Language Processing: Chatbot
## Pizzeria Restaurant Booking 

Round-the-clock top quality customer service has become the standard to maintaining brand loyalty â€“ particularly in the hospitality industry. Conversational agents, colloquially known as Chatbots, use natural language understanding to respond to a customer and
provide them with what they need. A well-designed Chatbot can simulate top-tier customer service 24/7, while roleplaying
as a friend, a search engine, or a receptionist all in one, freeing up time, costs, and mental load for employees. Papa's pizzeria can do all of these things, adapting smoothly and fluently to different circumstances and inputs. Very bare bones early Natural Language processing, that follows a template-based approach.

## Installation

Basic NLP libraries used, limited to NLTK and SciKitLearn for Feature Extraction.
Database management used SQLite3.
JobLib for loading models in and out. 

## Methodology

- Concepts utilised: Word Embeddings/ Vectorizers, Cosine Similarity, Intent Matching and Bag-of-words model

## Future Plans
- I will continue by developing more intricate Chatbot systems, that include deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and pre-trained transformers that I will fine tune and build upon for my specific use case.
